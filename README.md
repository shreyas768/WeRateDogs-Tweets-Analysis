# WeRateDogs-Tweets-Analysis

This project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

The project is based on "WeRateDogs" Twitter page, a page which rates pictures & videos of dogs.They also tag each dog with a different category out of “doggo”, “floofer”, “pupper”, or “puppo”.

An archive of this Twitter data for WeRateDogs’ tweets was provided as a CSV file. Two more sources of data were also gathered as part of this project: predictions for which type of dog is present in each picture ( passed through an image classification algorithm) and additional tweet information acquired from Twitter API.

The project consists mainly of following steps: Gathering Data, Assessment, Cleaning and Visual Analysis. Datasets were inspect for quality & tidiness issues.
